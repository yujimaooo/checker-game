# Checker Game with AI

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a checker game that includes an AI opponent. The AI makes decisions based on straightforward rules and could be further enhanced with more sophisticated strategies.

## 👣 Features
Checker Game Implementation: Play a standard game of checkers against the AI.
AI Opponent: The AI opponent always tries to jump if it can and makes a basic move if jumping is not possible.
Potential for Improvement: The AI's decision-making can be enhanced by implementing advanced strategies and learning from past games.

## 🤖 AI Strategy
The AI currently follows these rules:

It tries to jump if a jump move is available.
If no jump move is available, it makes the first available legal move.

## ⚙️ Future Improvements
The AI can be enhanced by:
- Implementing more advanced strategies.
- Learning from human players in past games.
- Incorporating an evaluation function that assigns a score to each possible move based on factors such as the number of pieces captured or the safety of the piece.
