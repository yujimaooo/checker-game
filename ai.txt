My AI has a straightforward approach but not just pick a random/arbitrary legal move: 
it always try to jump if it can, and make a basic move if that is not possible. 
I tried to make it work by picking the first available legal move, but i had a hard time
fixing all the bugs. The pick-next-move algorithm would potentially be improved by
implementing more advanced strategies, let it learn some strategies from human players in past games
It potentially can incorporate an evaluation function that assigns a score to each possible move, 
based on factors such as the number of pieces captured or the safety of the piece.
